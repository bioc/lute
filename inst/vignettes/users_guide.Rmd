# Deconvolution basics

To perform deconvolution, we need to consider the following terms:

* $p$ : Vector of true type proportions. These correspond to the columns in $Z$, 
and the ordering of types should be the same in each.

* $Z$ : The reference/signature matrix consisting of types (columns) and markers (rows)
and the signal amounts (e.g. expression logcounts, etc.). The columns correspond to
values in $p$, and the rows correspond to rows in $Y$.

* $Y$ : The convoluted signal matrix for which we wish to generate deconvolution 
predictions by type. The rows in $Y$ correspond to the rows in $Z$, and the columns
correspond to samples (e.g. bulk tissue samples, etc.).
