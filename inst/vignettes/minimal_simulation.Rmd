This vignette shows how to run a minimal deconvolution simulation on example 
datasets.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(lute)
```

# Simulation setup

We need to define the core deconvolution objects to run the simulation. These are
the following 3 list variables:

* `lgv` : Marker signals. These are used to calculate $Z$. 

* `lsv` : Size factors. These are used to transform $Z$ and also to make the $Y$ pseudo-bulked sample.

* `lpv` : True prediction values. These are used to make the $Y$ pseudo-bulked sample and
to compare predictions returned from deconvolution.
